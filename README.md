# Week3_Day2_ContactsHW

Problem
1. Implement a content provider into your weekend project. 
2. Write an simple app that will retrieve contacts from the system provider

The first problem should be good. The second one I didn't get to the point where I could populate contacts into the Recycler or ListView.
but got to the point where the permissions dialogue showed.
